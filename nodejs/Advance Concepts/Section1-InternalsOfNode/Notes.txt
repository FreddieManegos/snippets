3. Module Implementation
    https://github.com/nodejs/node

    jS code -> NodeJS JS Side -> process.binding()[Connects JS and C++ functions] -> V8 [Converts values between JS & C++ World] 
    -> Node's C++ Side -> libuv [Gives node easy access to underlying OS]

4. Node Backend by C++


5. The Basics of Threads
    Event Loop -> handle asynchrounous Loop

    Process -> instance of a program -> a single process has a multiple threads
    Thread -> a little to do list  
    A core can process multiple threads -> multi-threading

6. The Node Event Loop
    Node program   -> One Thread inside is the event loop
    Difficult to understand the event loop


9. Is Node Single Threaded?
    Node Event Loop -> Single Threaded
    Some of Node Framework/Std Lib -> Not Single Threaded

    Many core 

11. The Libuv Thread Pool

12. Threadpools with Multi-threading

12. Changing Threadpools
    Question    

15. Explaining OS Operations

16. Libuv OS Delegation

20. Unexpected Event Loop Events

    ThreadPool -> FS Module
    OS -> HTTPS
