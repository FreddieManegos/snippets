Enhancing Performance of Node

1. Enhancing Performance
    Improving Node Performance
        Use Node in 'Cluster' Mode -> Recommended
        Use Worker Threads -> Experimental

2. Blocking the Event Loop
    Clustering
                Single Thread
    Request ->  Node Server     -> Response

 3. Clustering in Theory


                    ->  Single Thread - Node Server
 
    CLuster Manager ->  Single Thread - Node Server   
                        
                    ->  Single Thread - Node Server

    RUN node index.js

        [ index.js ]  -> Node Instance 

    With Clustering 
            |---------------------------------------------------
        [ index.js ]  -> [ Cluster Manager ] -> cluster.fork() -|
