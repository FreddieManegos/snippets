Angular and Forms 
{
	value: {
		//key value pairs
		name: 'Fred',
		email: 'test@test.com'
	}
	valid: true
}	
	
Two Approaches

Template-Driven 
	- Angular infers the Form Object from the DOM

Reactive 
	- Form is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM
	
ngModelGroup 
	Group the forms
	
Patch Value 
	this.signupForm.form.patchValue({
		'user-data': {
			username: suggestedName
		}
	}) // change the specific field of data here
