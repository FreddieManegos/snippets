Modules & Optimization
---
What are Modules?

Modules -> Bundling blocks together in Angular (Component, Directive, Pipes, etc)
		Angular analyzes NgModules to "understand" your application and its features
		Angular modules define all building blocks your app uses: Component, Directives, Services
		App requires at least one module
		Core Angular features are included in Angular modules
		You can't use a feature/building block without including it in a module
