Basic of Angular 
	Modules
	Components
	Templates, Directives and Data Binding
	Services and Dependency Injection
	Routing


Intro to Module 
	Angular apps are modular -> NgModules (containers for codes)
	defined by @NgModule() decorator 
		declarations-> components, directives, and pipes
		exports-> subset of declarations 
		imports-> other modules
		provides-> creators of servicess
		bootstrap-> main application view, hosts all views 
	NgModule provide compilation contect for their components

Intro to Components & Templates 
	A component -> patch of screen called a view 
	@Component decorator -> identifies the class immediately 
		selector-> CSS 
		templateURL -> html template 
		providers-> array of services that the component requires
	Templates and Views
	
	Data Binding	
		Two-way data binding
		String interpolation -> 
		Property Binding ->
		Event Binding -> 
	
	Pipes - declara display-value transformations 
		@Pipe decorator 
		To specify a value transformation in an HTML template, use the pipe operator (|).
		{{interpolated_value | pipe_name}}
	
	Directives  -> Templates are dynamics
		@Directive decorator
			two kinds of directive 
				structural -> alter layout by adding,removing, and replacing elements in the DOM
				attribute -> alter apperance or behavior of an existing elements
				ngModel -> 
				
Intro to services and dependency injection
	Service might depend on the HttpClient service 
	DI - inject a service into a component, giving the component access to that service class 
		@Injectable() decorator -> provide the metadata inject it into a component
