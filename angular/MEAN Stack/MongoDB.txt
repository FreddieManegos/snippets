Comparing SQL vs NoSQL

	NoSQL
		MongoDB, CouchDB
		Enforces no Data Schema
		Less Focused on Relations
		Independent Documents
		Great for: Logs, Orders, (Chat) Messages
	
	SQL
		MySQL, PostgreSQL
		Enforces a Strict Data Schema
		Relations are a Core Feature
		Records are Related
		Great for: Shopping Carts, Contacts, Networks
		
Connecting Angular to the Database?
