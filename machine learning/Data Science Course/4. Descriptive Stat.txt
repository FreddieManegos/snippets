Visualizing data

Representation of Categorical Variables - Visualization 
* Frequency distribution tables
* Histogram
* Bar Charts 
* Pie Charts (Relative Frequency)
* Pareto Diagram (Descending order of frequncy) Freq, Relative Freq, Cumulative Freq
	Pareto Principle - 80-20 rule
	** Frequency is the number of occurences of each item
