The Basic of Probability
----------
Chance of Success and Fail
What is probability?
	Chance of things to happen
	The likelihood of an event occuring
	e.g.
		Flipping of a coin
			Two possible events
Def.
	A -> Event
	P(A) -> Probability
	---
	P(A) = preferred(favourable) / all(sample space)

	e.g
	A -> Head (Coin) only preferred outcome
	P(A) = 1 / 2 = 0.5

	A -> 4 (Dice) preferred outcomes -> 1
				  total possible outcomes -> 6
	P(A) = 1 / 6 ~ -.0167

	Independent Event to occur at the same time
	P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
	e.g
	P(Ace and Spade) = P(Ace) * P(Spade)
					 = 4/ 52  * 1/4 = 4/208 ~ 0.019231
	
	Winning the lottery
	A -> Lotto -> preferred outcomes -> amount of tickets
			   -> total possible outcomes -> 175 million
		
		P(A) = 1 / 175 m = 0.0000000005
