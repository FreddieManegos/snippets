Analysis vs Analytics

Analysis - analysis of the past of the data. Explains How? and Why?
	Qualitative Analysis - How? & Why? (SWOT)
	Quantitative -> Data + How sales decreased last summer


Analytics - explore potential future events. 
	Two types: 
		Qualitative - Intuition + Analysis
		Quantitative - Formulas + Algorithms

So, then
	Business Analysis != Business Analytics

What is a Business Intelligence (BI)
	the process of analysing and reporting historical business d ata.
	aims to explain past events using business data
	preliminary step of predictive analytics
		1. Analyse past data and extract useful insights
		2. Create appropriate models 

	PREMILINARY DATA REPORT - First Step of any data analysis
	REPORTING WITH VISUALs & CREATING DASHBOARDS - 
	
Machine Learning: The Ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed
	- Creating and Implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use this data to: 
		+ Make Predictions
		+ Analyse Patterns 
		+ Give Recommendations 

Artificial Intelligence - simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers

PART 2:
DATA - 
	Traditional Data - data from db
	Big Data - extremely large number of data
		Three formats - structured, semi-structured, unstructured
		3Vs, 5Vs, 7Vs, 11Vs
			vissions
			value
			visualisation
			variability
		Volume: Distributed between many computers
		Variety: Images, Audio, etc
		Velocity: Extract patterns must be fast
				Retrieved in real-time

PART 3
	The reason behind these Disciplines
	
	Storytelling is a crucial skill
		Data Scientist should have the ability to express complex mathematical and programming concepts to end users. 
	EXcell, STATA, SPSS
